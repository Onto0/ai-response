# Typing Bot (GPT-2 Powered)
## **I WILL NOT GUARANTEE ANY HELP WITH THIS IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS**

Another warning this AI has no filter and can be offensive 😁
it is sometimes crashes out also

This script generates text using GPT-2 and types it out in any text field you are selected on by simulating keyboard inputs. The goal? Send ridiculous AI-generated messages automatically.

## What This Does
- Uses GPT-2 to generate random text.  
- Simulates typing with `pynput`.  
- Automatically sends messages by pressing Enter.  
- Builds on the previous message to create longer, chaotic stories.
